    <h2>opening tag</h2>
    <p>In HTML, an opening tag marks the beginning of an element and is enclosed in angle brackets < and> with the
            element name in between, like for a paragraph. </p>
    <h3>closing tag</h3>
    <p>An opening tag begins a section of page content, and a closing tag ends it. For example, to markup a section of
        text as a paragraph, you would open the paragraph with an opening paragraph tag
    <p> and close it with a closing paragraph tag </p> (closing tags always proceed the element with a /).</p>
    <h2>attribute</h2>
    <p>HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. It is a piece
        of markup language used to adjust the behavior or display of an HTML element.HTML attributes are a modifier of a
        HTML element type.</p>
